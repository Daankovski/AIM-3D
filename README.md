<h3><b>Things to be proud of</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A controller script that was OOP, so it could be replaced if necessary. <br><i>AIM-3D/Assets/_Scripts/Controller.cs</i></li>
  <li>That we pulled of a working 4 player co-op game in 4 weeks time.</li>
  <li>A menu that worked with a controller.</li>
  <li>A PlayerSpawner that took input from the Game Settings menu and implemented it in the game. <br><i>AIM-3D/Assets/_Scripts/PlayerSpawner.cs;</i></li>
  <li>A working Item Spawner Script where all items have diffrent functions and values.<br>
  <i>AIM-3D/Assets/_Scripts/ItemSpawner.cs</i></li>
  <li>The fact that the amount of damage done to a player affects the gameplay in a critical way.<br>
  <i>AIM-3D/Assets/_Scripts?PlayerMovement.cs; Lines 156 - 186</i></li>
</ul>
